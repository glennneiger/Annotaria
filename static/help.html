		<h4>Reader mode:</h4>
		<section>
			<p>
				Reader Mode enables the possibilities to open a document, read its relative annotations and apply filters on them.
			</p>			
			<p>
				The global annotations, meaning the annotations concerning the whole document (e.g. the title), are displayed in the south region of the dashboard, in the panel named "Document Properties".
			</p>
			<p>
				The local annotations, meaning the annotations concerning a specific part of the document (e.g. a score given to a paragraph), are displayed directly in the document. Each kind of local annotation is associated with a specific color. Furthermore, if the same portion of the document is annotated more than once, the relative text will be gray.
			</p>
		</section>
		<h4>Annotator mode:</h4>
		<section>
			<p>
				Annotator Mode enables the possibilities to add new annotations of your own.
			</p>
			<p>
				In order to do that, you need to log with name and email. Then you may add new annotations, both global and local, via the panel located in the east side of the dashboard.
			</p>
			<p>
				To modify the annotations you have just created, remove them or save them persistently in the remote repository, you have to use the panel named "Unsaved Annotations", located in the south side of the dashboard.
